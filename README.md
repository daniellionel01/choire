## Introduction

Choire works in a gleam monorepo or singular project. It does two things for you:
- Check for outdated dependencies
- Check for different version of the same dependency across different gleam apps

## Usage

```sh
$ gleam add choire@1
```

```sh
$ gleam run -m choire
```

## Development

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
```
